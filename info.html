    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2>About Our Product</h2>
            <p>We are not affiliated with any of the brands whose designs inspire us. All products are replicas created in the style of famous models. We strive to make a luxury look accessible to everyone.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Payment</h2>
            <p>We work on full prepayment, but installment payment is also possible — check the terms with our <a href="https://t.me/kirito_ls" target="_blank">manager</a>. This is due to the wide variety of models, colors, and sizes in our assortment, as well as limited financial capacity for purchasing large batches of goods.</p><br>
            <p>In some cases, certain items may be available for payment on delivery — such products are published separately in our <a href="https://t.me/kirito_sneakers">Telegram channel</a>.</p><br>
            <p>Currently, all orders are accepted exclusively via <a href="https://t.me/kirito_ls">Telegram</a> or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kirito_sneakers?igsh=MTB1bzNheTJoaXZvMg%3D%3D&utm_source=qr">Instagram direct messages</a>.</p>
        </li>

            <h2>Shoe Quality</h2>
            <p>Our store offers three levels of shoe quality:<br><br></p>
            <ol>
                <li><p><b>Excellent Quality</b> - the highest quality level among replicas. Premium materials and high precision in details are used. Only the original can be better.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Good Quality</b> - shoes made from quality materials with original logos. Differ from Excellent Quality only by the level of workmanship.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Mid Quality</b> - shoes made from simplified materials but still with branded logos. They have the lowest price but don’t worry — such shoes are often sold on platforms like OLX or Prom, though sellers may not always specify this.</p></li>
            </ol><br>
            <p><b>Note:</b> each model may have several quality options. Detailed information can be conveniently viewed on our website.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Delivery</h2>
            <p>Free worldwide shipping.</p><br>
            <p>Delivery to Nova Poshta branches in Ukraine — from 70 UAH.</p><br>
            <p>Order processing takes from 12 to 14 business days.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Custom Orders</h2>
            <p>We accept orders for shoes and other clothing even if they are not in our current assortment. You can choose exactly the product you need and receive it as soon as possible.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Referral System and Discounts</h2>
            <p>We have a referral system, discounts, and other bonuses. If you have a <b>promo code</b>, be sure to inform the manager during your purchase — the discount will be applied to your order.</p><br>
            <p>After each order, you also receive a <b>thank-you letter</b> with a <b>personal promo code</b> for a <b>10% discount</b> on your next purchase.</p><br>
            <p>You can also invite a <b>friend</b>: if they make a purchase, you will get a <b>5% discount</b> on any pair.</p>
        </li>
